## Count the Monkeys!


### Description:
You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.




### Solution


```python
def monkey_count(n):
    return [x for x in range(1, n+1)]
```
